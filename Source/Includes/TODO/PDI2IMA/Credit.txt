"Here is a utility program written in Turbo C++ for DOS to convert PDI to IMA format. 
It will run in DOSBox, and is of course limited to 8.3 filenames. 
Only PDI type 1 images are supported; let me know if you find a type 1 image that doesn't convert correctly. 
DOS executable and source code are in the attached archive."
